  "Corals represent an exceptional biodiversity, and are present in both tropical and cold waters. Scientists estimate that coral reefs are home to more than 25% of marine species and yet they cover less than 0.2% of the ocean. Corals are also at the core of the formation of other ecosystems.",
  "Reefs only cover 0.2% of the oceans. Yet they protect more than 150,000 kilometres of coastline in more than 100 countries and territories. They can form a barrier that absorbs wave energy and thus help reduce coastal erosion.",
  "Approximately 1 billion people live within 100 kilometres of coral reefs and are likely to benefit from their ecosystem services. 500 million people directly depend on them, i.e. almost 8% of the worldâ€™s population, in terms of coastal protection, fisheries resources and tourism.",
  "Reefs are often an essential part in the economy of the tropical regions where they are located. They attract divers, snorkelers, recreational fishermen and beach and white sand enthusiasts.",
